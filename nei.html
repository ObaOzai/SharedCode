     "The sages does nothing yet nothing stays undone" is a core concept in Daoism, specifically referring to the principle of wu wei (無為), 
       which translates to "non-action" or "effortless action."</p>

     <p>This doesn't mean complete inactivity, but rather acting in accordance with the Dao, the natural order of the universe, without forceful 
         striving or unnecessary effort. The sage, in tune with what is referenced simply as Dao "the way", achieves more by acting naturally and allowing things to unfold, 
         rather than trying to force outcomes.</p> 


     <p>
      Neigong (pronounced "nay-gung") is a Daoist term that translates to 
      "internal skill" or "internal work". It refers to a type of training used 
      in some martial arts and health practices that focuses on cultivating 
      and harnessing the body's internal energy, or qi (also spelled chi).
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike external practices that emphasize physical strength 
      and technique, neigong focuses on developing internal awareness, 
      coordination, and the flow of qi through the body's energetic pathways. 
      This can involve practices such as specific breathing methods, precise 
      body alignments, meditation, and visualizations to influence the 
      circulation of energy and blood.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      The goal of the studies of these practices is to achieve a deeper understanding and control of one's own 
      internal processes and energy system, which can lead to improved health, 
      longevity, and heightened martial arts abilities, including increased 
      strength, agility, and power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neigong is not a specific set of exercises, but rather a progressive 
      series of practice stages a person undergoes. It's considered an advanced 
      form of training, often associated with internal martial arts like 
      Taijiquan. Many qigong practices 
      can be considered to be components of neigong, serving as tools for cultivating 
      internal energy and preparing the body for more advanced levels of 
      internal work.
    </p>



    <p>It's common to view Neigong as a foundational step towards Neidan practice. Neigong helps build the necessary internal energy and skills,
       that generate the "voltage" that in turn  moves the "current" of Qi, so to speak. This energy "Qi", is later utilized in then Neidan practice for deeper inner 
       physical and inner transformations.</p>
 
     <p>In essence, Neidan practices rely on the abilities developed through Neigong to achieve higher levels of energetic and spiritual cultivation.</p> 

    <p>Timeline and key points:</p>

    <!--  -->
    <p>Early Daoist concepts emerged during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, often called the "Hundred Schools of Thought", saw the development of various 
      philosophical traditions, including Daoism.</P>



     <p>Laozi (or Lao Tzu), is often traditionally considered to be the founder of Daoism and to be author of the Dao De Jing.  Daoism flourished around the 6th century BCE.
      Zhuangzi (or Chuang Tzu), another influential Daoist thinker, lived from 369 to 286 BCE.</p>

     <p>Lǎozǐ (/ˈlaʊdzə/) is the modern pinyin romanization of 老子. It is not a personal name, but rather an honorific title, meaning 'old' or 'venerable'.</p>

     <p>Traditionally, the Tao Te Ching (Dao De Jing) is attributed to Laozi (Lao Tzu), a semi-legendary figure said to have lived in the 6th century BCE (Spring and Autumn period).</p>


    <p>Tao Te Ching was not composed until the Warring States period (c. 475 – 221 BC), and was the product of multiple authors, according to modern scholars.</P>
    

    <p>The name "China" is thought to derive from the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), but the term itself likely existed in some form prior.
      The term "Zhongguo", meaning "central country" or "central state", was used as early as the Western Zhou period (c. 1038–c. 1000 BCE) but did not consistently refer to the entire nation until much later.
      Daoism was formalized as a religion under the East Han dynasty (c. 2,000 years ago).
    </p>
 
    <p>
      In essence, the philosophical and religious ideas that form the basis of Daoism were part of Chinese culture for centuries before the region was formally known as "China" in the 
      way we understand it today.
    </p> 

    <p>
      Lao Tzu was not influenced by Buddhism, as Buddhism originated in India centuries after Lao Tzu's time. Lao Tzu, the reputed author of the Tao Te Ching, is a central figure in Taoism, a philosophy and religion that developed in ancient China. 
      Buddhism, on the other hand, emerged in India with Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) around the 6th to 4th centuries BCE.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buddhism began influencing Daoism significantly around the 5th century CE, following the standardization of Buddhist terminology and the vast translation of Buddhist 
      scriptures into Chinese. This period, particularly with the school of Numinous Treasure (Lingbao), saw Daoism adopt Buddhist concepts of monasticism, rituals, ethical rules, 
      and even philosophical ideas like cosmology and psychology. While Buddhism entered China earlier, its major impact on Daoism came later, coinciding with the standardization 
      of Buddhist texts and the resulting cultural exchange.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Buddhism arrived in China during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), but its initial impact on Daoism was more about using Daoist terminology to express Buddhist concepts. 
    </p>

    <!--   -->
    <p>
      The 5th century CE marks a turning point with the standardization of Buddhist terminology and the translation of Buddhist scriptures, leading to a more profound influence on Daoism.
    </p>
 
    <!-- FIXED: Closed <p> tags properly -->
    <p>Numinous Treasure (Lingbao)</p>
    <p>
      This Daoist school played a crucial role in integrating Buddhist ideas into Daoism, adopting elements like monasticism, rituals, ethical rules, 
      and even concepts of cosmology and psychology.
    </p>
 
    <p>Mutual Influence:</p>
    <p>
      While Buddhism in some ways influenced parts of Daoism, there was also a reciprocal influence, with some Buddhist notions being shaped by later Daoist sectarian thoughts, 
      such as the concept of the ruler as a prophesied savior.
    </p> 

    <p>Competition and Coexistence:</p>
    <p>
      Despite some friction and competition for followers and influence, Daoism and Buddhism coexisted and even influenced each other in various aspects of Chinese culture, 
      including art, literature, and philosophy.
