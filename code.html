    This web page contains a set of over twenty technical studies I recently conducted across diverse domains including <strong>deep learning</strong>, <strong>statistical inference</strong>,
    <strong>natural language processing</strong>, <strong>image classification</strong>, and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>. These projects were developed as part of a
    broader effort to integrate practical machine learning applications with philosophical, educational, and real-world exploration of data.
    <br><br>
    Each notebook reflects a different line of inquiry—ranging from modeling financial churn and predicting unemployment rates to
    simulating lunar landers and performing audio digit recognition using MFCC spectrograms. All were run on local Linux hardware
    and documented carefully for learning, reproducibility, and future deployment.
   <br><br>
   Disclaimer
   <br>
These study notebooks are created by me as part of my personal learning process. The concepts and ideas I explore are not original — they are based on widely known information from various educational sources.

I write the notebooks myself, using code to explore and experiment with the topics, often with the help of publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs).

Please note that no academic institution or PhD expert reviews or certifies my work. These notebooks are simply me sharing my studies, ideas, and explorations.

Take everything here for what it is: personal learning made public.

        “Lunar Lander is a genre of video games loosely based on the 1969 landing of the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon.
        In Lunar Lander games, players control a spacecraft as it falls toward the surface of the Moon or other astronomical body,
        using thrusters to slow the ship's descent and control its horizontal motion to reach a safe landing area.
        Crashing into obstacles, hitting the surface at too high a velocity, or running out of fuel all result in failure.
        In some games in the genre, the ship's orientation must be adjusted as well as its horizontal and vertical velocities.” — Wikipedia

        “An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and falls over without additional help.
        It can be suspended stably in this inverted position by using a control system to monitor the angle of the pole and move the pivot point
        horizontally back under the center of mass when it starts to fall over, keeping it balanced. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem
        in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies. It is often implemented with the pivot point
        mounted on a cart that can move horizontally under control of an electronic servo system as shown in the photo;
        this is called a cart and pole apparatus.” — Wikipedia

        The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model used to explain or derive the likelihood of random processes.
        It suggests that an observed event is connected to a set of probability distributions, rather than a step-by-step sequence.
        <br><br>
        In this context, a Markov chain is modeled with hidden states that depend on the underlying process. The goal of HMM is to
        uncover information about this Markov chain by observing the hidden states.
        <br><br>
        Specifically, given a process X with hidden states Y, the HMM assumes the probability distribution of Y at each time step
        is independent of the historical values of X.

    <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        Over the past decades, major advances have been made in the field of audio recognition, especially using Deep Learning techniques.
        A common approach involves converting audio signals into spectrograms for visual processing and recognition.
        <br><br>
        Raw audio is typically represented as a waveform, which can be extremely data-heavy, even for short clips. This makes storage and
        computation expensive, especially at high sampling rates.
        <br><br>
        A more efficient alternative is to use spectrograms — specifically MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) spectrograms.
        These are generated using Fourier or Short-Time Fourier Transforms and represent audio in a 2D space: time on the X-axis and
        frequency coefficients on the Y-axis. This allows the audio to be treated as image data for model training.

        <br><br>
        A subset of 1,000 images is used — 830 for training and 170 for testing. The training set includes
        395 No Tumor and 435 Pituitary Tumor scans. Data augmentation is applied to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.

    <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        This project analyzes global meteorite landings using clustering and regression techniques.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Geographic Spread:</strong><br>
        Meteorites are widely distributed across temperate and equatorial regions, with limited presence in polar and oceanic zones due to accessibility limitations.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Summary Statistics:</strong><br>
        The average log-transformed mass is 3.40 (approximately 30 grams). Cluster 1 contains smaller meteorites, while Cluster 2 includes the largest and primarily iron-based types.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Analysis Steps:</strong><br>
        The dataset was cleaned, and mass values were transformed using a logarithmic scale. Regression models (linear, random forest, gradient boosting) were applied to predict mass. Latitude and year emerged as the most important features.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Clustering:</strong><br>
        K-Means clustering revealed four distinct groups, each with characteristic mass and geographic profiles. DBSCAN identified one high-density cluster and several outliers. Cluster 2 contains large iron-based meteorites; Cluster 1 shows broader geographic diversity with smaller mass.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Visualizations:</strong><br>
        Scatter plots, heatmaps, and boxplots were used to explore geographic distribution, mass, and classification types.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong><br>
        Meteorite discoveries are biased toward land areas, and larger meteorites tend to be geographically and compositionally distinct. The models achieved moderate performance (R² ~ 0.6). Including additional features like environmental data may improve predictions.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Future Work:</strong><br>
        Improvements could include tuning clustering parameters, expanding temporal trend analysis, and integrating external datasets such as meteor shower timelines or terrain data.

    <br>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        Hospital management is a vital area that gained a lot of attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inefficient distribution of resources like beds
        and ventilators can lead to serious complications. However, this can be mitigated by predicting the Length of Stay (LOS) of a patient before
        admission. Once this is determined, hospitals can better plan treatment, resource use, and staffing to reduce LOS and improve recovery rates.
        <br><br>
        HealthPlus Hospital has been facing losses in both revenue and life due to inefficient management. The absence of a reliable system to allocate
        beds, equipment, and staff has worsened the issue.
        <br><br>
        In this first study, we begin exploring how LOS prediction can enable smarter treatment pipelines and optimize hospital infrastructure. We
        introduce the problem scope, data structure, and prepare initial exploratory analysis to understand the underlying variables.

        <br><br>
        Cross-validation and metric evaluation (precision, recall, F1 score) guide the selection of optimal models. Through this, we begin to expose
        hidden patterns in patient admission records that strongly correlate with predicted LOS durations.

        Our analysis demonstrates how such a system could help HealthPlus Hospital proactively manage patient flow, staff workload, and resource
        availability — ultimately improving efficiency and care quality.

        There is a huge demand for used cars in the Indian market today. As new car sales have slowed in recent years, the pre-owned car market has grown steadily,
        now surpassing the new car market in volume.
        <br><br>
        In 2018–19, approximately 4 million second-hand cars were sold, compared to 3.6 million new cars. This trend suggests a shift in demand toward pre-owned vehicles —

        <br><br>
        Cars4U is a budding tech start-up seeking to establish itself in this growing market. Unlike the deterministic pricing of new vehicles (regulated by OEMs),

    <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        Understanding socio-economic indicators is essential for evaluating national development, policy impact, and global inequality.
        While GDP is often used as a proxy for economic health, it does not fully capture societal well-being.
        <br><br>
        This project explores a rich dataset containing multiple socio-economic attributes from countries worldwide.
        Through clustering and visualization techniques, the study aims to uncover natural groupings of nations based on development patterns,
        education, health, income distribution, and access to infrastructure.
        <br><br>
        These clusters can guide targeted development strategies and provide insight into global economic structures beyond GDP.

        In this case study, we explore Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using an air pollution dataset
        that captures 13 months of data on major pollutants and meteorological variables in a metropolitan city.
        <br><br>
        PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variability as possible,
        revealing latent patterns and underlying correlations between pollutant levels and environmental conditions.

        Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there's enough evidence to support a claim about a population parameter.
        It involves comparing observed data against a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, drawing conclusions based on calculated test statistics
        such as p-values and confidence intervals.
